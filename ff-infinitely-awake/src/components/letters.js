Between researching and getting videos/strats and calling mechanics, leading the group and setting up events and practice sessions, and teaching mechanics when we're having trouble... you put in a lot of effort, and it shows. I love your chaotic silliness, and I hope we can play more together, FFXIV and beyond."

I know you always work to get events going and to make everyone feel welcome and included, and it's really appreciated by stinkis like me. Though, do you need to slap me every time you see me? We all appreciate you Ras."

    body: "Ras, my daughter I know that you've been dealing with a lot over the course of time but I know in my heart that our love for each other is enough to get us through. Strength comes in many forms so with the love and care you've shown for this static we know that you're string enough to conquer anything. We remember and stay true to who we are to accomplish anything and I love you for taking on such a big role and making this static great. Thanks so much."

    body: "Ras, thank you for everything you do and all the hard work you put into this team. You are the model for me here; an inspiration for me to be more like you and get better like you. You have been a wonderful friend and mentor and I want to be around to help you get that 100 parse because I know you can do it! I came here looking for a raid team but because of you and everyone else I have found something much more special and it means the world to me. Thank you so much and keep being awesome, Ras."

    body: "Ras youâ€™re loved more than you know. Despite the fact that according to the family tree Iâ€™m your grandmother, you really do feel like a flesh and blood sister to me and I love you like one.  I can tell you genuinely care about all of your friends, even if you sometimes have a hard time showing it. I can always vent to you or ask you for advice and you can take it in stride and help me out. You never fail to make me laugh. I enjoy raiding with you so much with all the strange and cursed in-jokes and banter, many of which come from your antics. Youâ€™re very intelligent and I can tell you work hard at everything you do. Youâ€™re also an incredibly skilled player. You always figure out mechanics quickly and understand them well enough to call them out and teach to the people who arenâ€™t picking it up as quickly. On top of that youâ€™re healing, a position I donâ€™t envy in the slightest, and managing to pull top numbers while youâ€™re at it. That takes absolute skill, dedication, and hard work.Youâ€™re a hard worker, a phenomenal player, and a great friend. I wouldnâ€™t want anyone else to be my raid leader."
